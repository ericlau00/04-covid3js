    <p>
      This line chart shows the amount of COVID-19 articles written over time.
      There is a dip in the number of articles written on the weekends because
      most people read news on business days. Thus, less articles will be
      written on the days where less people read them. We see that growth in
      COVID-related articles began on January 19, 2020. And February 23rd
      onwards, the number of articles began growing exponentially. This is
      around the time when the first case of local transmission of the virus was
      discovered in the United States (February 26, 2020). The number of
      articles start decreasing from March 29th onwards and start stagnating
      from April 5th onwards. We are not sure what causes this stagnation,
      perhaps because our data source did not discover any more articles in
      their time of recording this data.
    </p>
    <div id="bar-chart"></div>
    <p>
      This bar chart shows the subjectivity ratings of COVID-19-related news
      outlets (or domains). The subjectivity values range from 0.0 to 1.0,
      inclusive, where 0.0 is most objective and 1.0 is most subjective. This
      data shows that the most objective COVID-news sources are Wired, Finsmes,
      and Altassets. While the most subjective sources are Mashable,
      Iotworldtoday, and Dzone.

    <div id="wordcloud"></div>
    <div class="legend">
      Commonly used words are larger and slightly faded in color. Less common
      words are smaller and darker.
    </div>
    <p>
      The most common words are names of countries, days of the week, and the
      name of news outlets. The days of the week are to be expected because they
      are listed as part of the article publish date, among other details. The
      frequency in the names of proper locations (i.e. U.S., China, U.K.) shows
      how widespread COVID is, with China taking the lead in frequency (to be
      expected since Wuhan, China is COVID's location of origin).
